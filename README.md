# Calculate the Duration of Days
 
In many countries, you can stay without a visa or residence permit for a duration of 90 days. In a lot of cases, this duration is reset after 180 days have passed. It is often hard to calculate this using a calendar alone. You can get a rough estimate by counting the days you have spent in the country in question in the last 6 month. Usually, the number of days you are allowed to stay is calculated on the date of entry and does not reset thereafter.

This app helps people calculate the number of days during different stays and get a sum of days they have spent within the last 180 days, assuming that the maximum amount allowed is 90.

# Warning

This app is meant as guidance. I do not guarantee that this is correct or that your calculation will be accepted by the relevant authorities. When staying in a foreign country, always be sure to have a few 'days to spare' in case something unexpected happens, and be aware of the regulations.

**For a proper assessment of your situation, always contact the relevant immigration authorities!**
